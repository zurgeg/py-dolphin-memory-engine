# Python Dolphin Memory Engine

[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henriquegemignani/py-dolphin-memory-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henriquegemignani/py-dolphin-memory-engine)
[![AppVeyor CI Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i5rb9s0w1l4ahbgj?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/henriquegemignani/py-dolphin-memory-engine)

A python library designed to read and write the emulated memory of [the Dolphin emulator](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) during runtime. 

Binary wheels are available on pypi for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Use `python -m pip install dolphin-memory-engine` with a modern enough version.


## System requirements
Any x86_64 based system should work, however, Mac OS is _not_ supported. Additionally, 32-bit x86 based systems are unsupported since Dolphin dropped their support.

You need to have Dolphin running ***and*** _have the emulation started_ for this program to be useful. As such, the system must meet Dolphin's [system requirements](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin#system-requirements). Additionally, at least 250 MB of free memory is required.
